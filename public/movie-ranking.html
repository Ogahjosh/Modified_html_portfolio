<h3>Everybody Hates Chris</h3>
<p>
    This is a very interesting tv series of 4 seasons.
    I love the characters, the setting and the humour used.

<h3> The Adventures of Merlin </h3>
<p>
    This is one of my best tv series ever. It has a mix
    of comedy, drama romance, suspence and fantasy. I recommend 
    this series to anyone that's looking for something interesting.

<h3> Friends </h3>
<p>
    This is one of my favourite comedy shows about a couple of
    friends and how they go through everyday life. It's funny, dramatic
    and interesting.
